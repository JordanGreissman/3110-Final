Style Guide
-----------
First read the 3110 style guide[1]. This document provides some style
guidelines *in addition to* the guidelines provided by the course style guide.

1) Indent by 2 spaces
2) Match expressions
    a) The arrows in each branch of a match expression should be aligned whenever
       this doesn't sacrifice readability.
    b) If it is necessary to explicitly denote the extent of a branch expression,
       parentheses are strongly preferred over `begin...end' blocks, e.g.:

      NOT PREFERRED

        match x with
        | pat1 -> 
        | pat2 -> begin
            ...
            ... end

      PREFERRED

        match x with
        | pat1 -> 
        | pat2 -> (
            ...
            ... )

3) Let expressions
    a) If a let expression is followed by the `in' keyword, `in' should go on the
       end of the last line of the expression.
    b) If a let expression must be broken into multiple lines, each line should
       be indented two spaces, e.g.:

        let f x y =
          let a = ... in
          let b =
          ... in
          e in

4) Naming conventions
    a) Function names should be snake case instead of camel case; e.g.
       `is_empty' is preferred over `isEmpty'.
    b) Module names should be camel case; e.g. `MyModule'.

5) Module conventions
    a) The module type will be the last argument to module functions
