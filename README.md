Gobi is a turn-based strategy game based off of Sid Meier's Civilization V. Your
task is to build a civilization that will stand the test of time. Build cities,
assemble armies, and destroy your opponents' civilizations -- before you are
destroyed yourself.

Gobi (formerly known as Gooby) was originally a final project for
[CS3110](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/cs3110/2016fa/) at Cornell. The
project team was:

 * [Austin Astorga](https://github.com/AAAstorga)
 * [Jordan Greissman](https://github.com/JordanGreissman)
 * [David Udelson](https://github.com/dudelson)
 * [Matt Barker](https://github.com/mattbarker016)

## Compilation instructions:

Make sure you have jbuilder (dune) installed. Then `jbuilder build`
from the root of the project will compile the game, and `jbuilder exec gobi`
will run it. The game looks much better in a full-screen terminal, so we
recommend making your termainal fullscreen if you are playing the game in a
native environment.
