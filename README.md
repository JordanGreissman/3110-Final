### Compilation instructions:
`make game' from the top-level directory of the extracted zip file will compile
and run the game. The game looks much better in a full-screen terminal, so we
recommend making your termainal fullscreen if you are playing the game in a
native environment, or fullscreening both the terminal and the 3110 VM, if you
are using that. Some game functionality requires the terminal to be able to
report the position of mouse clicks; this functionality does not exist in OSX
prior to Sierra. Therefore please use the 3110 VM to grade this project if you
are using either windows or OSX prior to Sierra.
