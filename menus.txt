Are menu options always available or, for example, is settle not available if
entity is not a settler? Would the entity menu be avaiable for selection if there
is no entity on the selected title (I think so).

Flatland (unsettled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
      - select next tile to move entity to?
    describe
    settle
      - if entity is a settler, builds a town hall on tile
    build
      - opens sub menu for hubs to be built
    wait
      - does nothing with the turn
      - civ has this because you have to expend all possible actions before
        ending your turn, this may be good for us as well
    attack
      - select adjacent tile to attack
  [h] hub
    none

Desert (unsettled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
    describe
    build
    wait
    attack
  [h] hub
    none

Forest (unsettled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
    describe
    build
    wait
    attack
    clear
      - clears forest
  [h] hub
    none

Mountain (unsettled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    none
  [h] hub
    none

Flatland (settled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
    describe
    wait
    enter hub
      - adds entity to hub, consuming entity
    destroy?
      - destroys hub, has some cost associate with it
    repair?
      - adds health back to hub? maybe only a certain unit can do this?
    attack
  [h] hub
    describe
    maybe destroy and repair should be here and not require an entity, but resources?

Desert (settled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
    describe
    wait
    enter hub
    destroy?
    repair?
    attack
  [h] hub
    describe

Forest (settled)
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    move
    describe
    wait
    enter hub
    destroy?
    repair?
    clear?
      - destroys lumber mill (are lumber mills the only hubs that can be built on forests?)
    attack
  [h] hub
    describe

Enemy tiles
  [t] tile
    describe
  [e] entity
    describe
  [h] hub
    describe
